# Project Description
The coronavirus took the entire world by surprise, changing everyone's daily routine. City dwellers no longer spent their free time outside, going to cafes and malls; more people were home, reading books. That attracted the attention of startups that rushed to develop new apps for book lovers.
You've been given a database of one of the services competing in this market. It contains data on books, publishers, authors, and customer ratings and reviews of books. This information will be used to generate a value proposition for a new product.

## Purpose 
The project aims to utilize the provided database to create a value proposition for a new product or service for book lovers. By analyzing the data, trends, and preferences of readers, opportunities will be identified to develop a unique offering. The goal is to create a compelling proposition that differentiates the new product from existing services and meets the needs of book enthusiasts.
